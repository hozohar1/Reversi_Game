# Reversi_Game🎮
A game created as part of the "Introduction to Artificial Intelligence and Data Science" course.
This project features a Reversi game, also known as Othello, played on an 8x8 game board. 
The game involves a match between a bot and a human player. 
The bot's behavior is determined by the minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning.
